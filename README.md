# Diploma-Thesis-Image-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
This repository contains the code developed for my diploma thesis, which focuses on various machine learning techniques for image classification. The project explores multiple algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and ensemble methods like Bagging, applied to a custom image dataset.
